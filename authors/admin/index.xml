      <description>Chuan-Xing Li is an assistant professor at Karolinska Institutet, Sweden. Her major research interests are computational systems biology and systems medicine. The current project is aimed to identify module-based biomarkers by integration analysis of multi-omics data using network modeling approaches, with subsequent module-based sub-phenotyping in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</description>
