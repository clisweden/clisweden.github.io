	abstract = {Rationale: COPD represents an umbrella diagnosis caused by a multitude of underlying mechanisms, and molecular sub-phenotyping is needed to facilitate the development of molecular diagnostic/prognostic tools and efficacious treatments.Objectives: To investigate whether multi-omics integration improves the accuracy of molecular classification of COPD in small cohorts.Measurements and Results: Nine omics data-blocks (mRNA, miRNA, proteomes, metabolomes) collected from several anatomical locations from 52 female subjects were integrated by similarity network fusion (SNF). Multi-omics integration significantly improved the accuracy of group classification of COPD patients from healthy never-smokers, and smokers with normal spirometry, reducing required group sizes from n=30 to n=6 at 95\% power. Seven different combinations of 4{\textendash}7 omics platforms achieved \&gt;95\% accuracy.Conclusions: For the first time, a quantitative relationship between multi-omics data integration and accuracy of data-driven classification power was demonstrated across 9 omics data-blocks. Integration of 5{\textendash}7 omics data-blocks enabled 100\% correct classification of COPD diagnosis with groups as small as n=6 individuals, despite strong confounding effects of current smoking. These results can serve as guidelines for the design of future systems-based multi-omics investigations, with indications that integration of 5{\textendash}6 data-blocks from several molecular levels and anatomical locations suffices to facilitate unsupervised molecular classification in small cohorts.Multi-omics integration drastically improves unsupervised molecular prediction of COPD; 100\% accuracy, subgroups n=6FootnotesThis manuscript has recently been accepted for publication in the European Respiratory Journal.
